                    He picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone.
                    Day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate.
                    He couldn't be sure. Day and nights had begun
                    to blend together creating confusion, but he knew it
                    was a long time. Much too long.

                    He had done everything right. There had been no mistakes throughout the entire process. It had been
                    perfection and he knew it without a doubt, but the results still stared back at him with the fact
                    that he had lost.

                    Since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see, they must have been formed quite
                    recently, that is, geologically speaking. What can explain these striations and their common
                    orientation? Did you ever hear about the Great Ice Age or the Pleistocene Epoch? Less than one
                    million years ago, in fact, some 12,000 years ago, an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode
                    over Burke Mountain in a southeastward direction. The many boulders frozen to the underside of the
                    ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode. The scratches or striations seen in the
                    park rocks were caused by these attached boulders. The ice sheet also plucked and rounded Burke
                    Mountain into the shape it possesses today.

                <p class="story-text">
                    Don't forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price. When you purchase
                    a
                    child the latest smartphone, you're also committing to a monthly phone bill. When you purchase the
                    latest gaming system, you're likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for
                    long
                    and want to purchase new titles to play. When you buy gifts it's important to remember that some
                    come
                    with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself.
